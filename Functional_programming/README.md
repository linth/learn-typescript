# Functional Programming (FP)
Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm where functions are first-class citizens and emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, supports functional programming concepts. Here are some important examples demonstrating functional programming in TypeScript:


# Pure Functions
A pure function is a function that, given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side effects (does not modify any state outside its scope).

# Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

# Function Composition
Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

# Currying
Currying is the technique of translating a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.

# Immutability
Immutability in functional programming ensures that data structures cannot be modified after they are created.

# Recursion
Recursion is a functional programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

# Monad (Optional Type)
Monads are a powerful concept in functional programming that allows for the composition of functions that produce a type of value that can encapsulate failure.

# Type Guards
TypeScript's type guards allow you to use functional patterns to ensure type safety.
